-------
It's the case study of &lt;Formal Design and Analysis of a GearController : an Industrial Case Study using UPPAAL>. The original models
are from the paper. And we extend the model with Observer pattern to verify all the 16 properties. The automata is in [mecelAB.xml](https://github.com/VincentCheungM/mecelAB/blob/master/mecelAB.xml) and 
the 16 properties are in  [mecelAB.q](https://github.com/VincentCheungM/mecelAB/blob/master/mecelAB.q)
